System requirements:

You will need access to a local terminal on your computer and be able to use matplot, python and numpy.

How to get and run code:

First clone my p1-start repository from https://github.com/rorystorm98/p1-start

To run this code you need to use the plot.py file that has the actual code in it. The files that I plotted are in the RAW-DATA file. It should show a graph of your data and a linear fit of the data. Then run python plot.py <name of file you want to run> 

Example.  $ python plot.py raw-data/Sp15_245L_sect-001_group-1_glass.raw

Once the graph is closed if should also print the Youngs Modulus of your data. This code should be able to be used with different data if it is formatted the same as the data in this repository and starts on line 33.

Files in this repository:

raw-data is the file with all of the data I wrote this program for, all files are formatted for this code besides Sp15_245L_sec-001_group-01_bendtest-aluminum.raw and Sp15_245L_sec-001_group-01_bendtest-tungsten.raw.
See aluminum1.raw through aluminum3.raw files for aluminum values and tungsten1.raw through tungsten3.raw files for tungsten values.
README is this file
contributors.txt is the list of people that contributed to this repository
plot.py contains the code used to create Stress vs Strain graphs.

What I learned:

During this project I have learned how important it is to stay organized when saving and modifying files and that using complicated file names can add to to amount of work that you have to do since it is easier to make mistakes with longer file names. 
This project also gave me alot of practice using the HJKL keys for navigation in vim. I am still having difficuly defaulting to those keays though since I am so used to using the arrow keys.
It is also helpful to make commits often, even if they are small, so it is easier to track changes and for a project where a certain number of commits are required it helps fill that requirement like I should have done for this project. Trying to make 25 commits for this project was alot harder than I thought it would be since I forgot that it was a requirment until I was almost completly finished with my code so I had to make a large number of commits that just changed the way my files look.

Overall I feel like this project really helped me understand what we have been covering in class and showed a good real world example of how coding can make projects easier once you understand it. I still haven't been able to figure out how to make the linear regresion apply only to the linear part of my data but from what i could see in the code from the rest of the class that has been common.
